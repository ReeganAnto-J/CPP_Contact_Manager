# Simple Contacts Manager with C++
## CRUD based CPP Console application

#### Introduction:
This is a simple CRUD application which is built using Visual C++. I have also implemented many necessary constraints within this program such that it handling almost every possible user errors and unlike my previous projects, I also made sure this to be as convenient as possible for the users.

I made this project in order to test my understanding of the C++ programming language.

Most of the program is written by myself hence I wouldn't consider this program to be anywhere close to be perfect or optimized; I had to copy only a single function from Geeks for Geeks and nothing more.

I am a third year student in the Artificial Intelligence and Data Science department of Adhi College of Engineering and Technology, and would appreciate any help you could provide me which could potentially improve my skills.

#### Key skills I applied in this project (In my humble opinion):
- File Handling
- Problem solving
- C++ STL containers
- Header files
- Procedural programming
- Pointers and Iterators
- Low level memory management
